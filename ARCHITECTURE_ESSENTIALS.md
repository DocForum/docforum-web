# ARCHITECTURE_ESSENTIALS.md — docforum-web

Frontend-only quick reference. Full product/system architecture lives in
`docforum-core`'s `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `ARCHITECTURE_ESSENTIALS.md` — read
those first if you're new to the org, not just this file.

## Stack
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- React Query for server state, Zustand for client-only UI state
- No localStorage/sessionStorage for anything server-derived — treat
  `docforum-core`'s API as the source of truth, always refetch/cache via
  React Query rather than hand-rolling persistence.

## Hard rules
1. **This repo never calls `docforum-escrow` or Stellar directly.** Wallet
   linking, payment status, escrow state — all of it comes from
   `docforum-core`'s API. If a screen needs Stellar-related data, that's a
   `docforum-core` API gap to file, not a reason to add a Stellar SDK
   dependency here.
2. Mirror `docforum-core`'s data model shapes in `src/types/models.ts` —
   don't invent parallel frontend-only shapes for the same entities.
3. Structure: `pages/ components/ features/ hooks/ services/ store/ types/`
   — keep this shape.

## Where things live
- `src/services/` — API client calls to `docforum-core`.
- `src/features/` — flow-specific logic (booking, referral-accept, order
  fulfillment selection, etc.) — one feature folder per PRD core flow.
- `src/pages/` — route-level components.

## Roadmap / status
See `ROADMAP.md` in this repo, and Phase 7 in `docforum-core`'s
`ROADMAP.md` for the original (pre-split) frontend phase this was carved
out of.
