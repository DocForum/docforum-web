# ARCHITECTURE_ESSENTIALS.md — docforum-web

Frontend-only quick reference. Full product/system architecture lives in
`docforum-core`'s `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `ARCHITECTURE_ESSENTIALS.md` — read
those first if you're new to the org, not just this file.

## Stack
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- React Query for server state, Zustand for client-only UI state
- No localStorage/sessionStorage for anything server-derived — treat
  `docforum-core`'s API as the source of truth, always refetch/cache via
  React Query rather than hand-rolling persistence.

## Hard rules
1. **This repo never calls `docforum-escrow` or Stellar directly.** Wallet
   linking, payment status, escrow state — all of it comes from
   `docforum-core`'s API. If a screen needs Stellar-related data, that's a
   `docforum-core` API gap to file, not a reason to add a Stellar SDK
   dependency here.
2. Mirror `docforum-core`'s data model shapes in `src/types/models.ts` —
   don't invent parallel frontend-only shapes for the same entities.
3. Structure: `pages/ components/ features/ hooks/ services/ store/ types/`
   — keep this shape.

## Where things live
- `src/services/` — API client calls to `docforum-core`. `api-client.ts` is
  the only place fetch/base-URL/error-envelope details live.
- `src/features/` — flow-specific logic (booking, referral-accept, order
  fulfillment selection, etc.) — one feature folder per PRD core flow.
- `src/pages/` — route-level components.
- `src/store/` — Zustand stores. `auth-store.ts` is intentionally
  in-memory only (not persisted) — see hard rule about
  localStorage/sessionStorage above; it applies to auth tokens too, not
  just business data.

## Deployment
- GitHub Pages, deployed on every push to `main` via
  `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`: https://docforum.github.io/docforum-web/
- **Connected to a live backend as of 2026-09-14** —
  `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is set at build time to `docforum-core`'s Render
  preview deployment (`https://docforum-core-api.onrender.com`, see that
  repo's `docs/adr/0003-render-preview-deployment.md`). Signup/login
  actually work end-to-end against a real Postgres now. Still a
  **preview**, not production: the free-tier backend spins down after 15
  minutes idle (~1 minute cold-start delay on the next request), and its
  Postgres expires 2026-10-14 unless renewed — data is disposable.
- Router is `HashRouter`, not `BrowserRouter` — GitHub Pages has no
  server-side rewrite for client-side routes, so a deep link like `/login`
  would 404 on refresh under history-API routing. Switch back to
  `BrowserRouter` if this ever deploys somewhere with a real rewrite rule
  (e.g. behind `docforum-core` itself, or Vercel/Netlify).
- `vite.config.ts`'s `base` is conditional on `GITHUB_PAGES=true` (set by
  `npm run build:pages`) — plain `npm run build` still serves from `/`.

## Known gaps against the real API (docforum-core Phase 1 landed 2026-09-14)
`docforum-core` now has a real, tested API — see its `docs/api/README.md`.
The original W1 assumptions here turned out correct (`POST /auth/signup`/
`login`/`logout`, `{ user, accessToken }`, `{ message: string }` error
envelope, `fullName` is a real column, `role` restricted to `patient`/
`doctor` at signup — server-enforced too, not just this UI).
`credentials: 'include'` is now set on the `fetch` call in
`api-client.ts` (fixed 2026-09-14, alongside the Render connection — the
real backend's refresh cookie is `SameSite=None; Secure`, cross-site
between this repo's `github.io` domain and Render's, so it's required for
the cookie to be sent/received at all). One gap remains:
- **`POST /auth/refresh` exists on the backend but nothing here calls
  it.** `auth-store.ts` still has no silent-reauth-on-reload flow — a
  page refresh loses the session even though the refresh cookie would
  still be valid. Tracked, not built (Phase W1 was scoped to
  signup/login only).
- Local-dev-only caveat inherited from the backend: its refresh cookie is
  `sameSite: 'lax'`/`secure: false`, which may not survive true
  cross-origin (different ports) `fetch` + `credentials: 'include'` in
  every browser — not verified end-to-end. See `docforum-core`'s
  `docs/api/README.md`.

## Known assumptions — Phase W2 (dependents, health profile, acting-for)

These API shapes are assumed and not yet implemented in `docforum-core`.
Reconcile against the real contract once the corresponding backend issues
land.

### Dependents (docforum-core#42)
- `GET /patients/me/dependents` → `Dependent[]`
- `POST /patients/me/dependents` (body: `{fullName, dateOfBirth, relationship}`) → `Dependent`
- `PATCH /patients/me/dependents/:id` (body: `{fullName, dateOfBirth, relationship}`) → `Dependent`
- `POST /patients/me/dependents/:id/handover-invite` (body: `{email}`) → `Dependent`
- `POST /patients/me/dependents/:id/handover-invite/resend` → `Dependent`
- `POST /auth/claim-account` (body: `{token, email, password}`) → `void`
- `Dependent` shape: `{id, guardianProfileId, fullName, dateOfBirth, relationship: 'parent'|'guardian'|'carer', handoverStatus: 'not_eligible'|'eligible'|'invited'|'claimed', claimEmail?, claimInviteExpiresAt?, createdAt, updatedAt}`

### Health profile (docforum-core#59)
- `GET /patients/:profileId/health/:section` → `HealthEntry[]`
- `POST /patients/:profileId/health` (body: `{section, name, details?}`) → `HealthEntry`
- `PATCH /patients/:profileId/health/:entryId` (body: `{name, details?}`) → `HealthEntry`
- `DELETE /patients/:profileId/health/:entryId` → `void`
- `HealthEntry` shape: `{id, patientProfileId, section: 'allergies'|'conditions'|'medications', name, details?, version, previousValue?, updatedAt, createdAt}`

### Acting-for profile switcher (#20)
No new backend endpoint. The switcher is client-only UI state (Zustand
store). Every patient API call and React Query key includes the selected
`patientProfileId` so caches never mix profiles.

## Roadmap / status
See `ROADMAP.md` in this repo, and Phase 7 in `docforum-core`'s
`ROADMAP.md` for the original (pre-split) frontend phase this was carved
out of.
